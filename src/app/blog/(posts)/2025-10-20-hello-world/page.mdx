After a lot of hesitation, I’ve finally taken the plunge and built a brand new website. It’s built with Next.js, MDX, and StyleX.

This site isn’t just a portfolio, though; I’m treating it as a sandbox to explore new technologies.

One of my goals is to write more regularly about the various side projects I’m working on, documenting what I learn along the way.
I also want to create a space for smaller, bite-sized thoughts or notes that don’t quite fit as full blog posts, but could still be helpful or interesting to others.
